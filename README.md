## 👋 Hi, I'm Alejandro Sánchez  
### Data Scientist | Machine Learning & AI | Bioinformatics 📊🧬  

I'm a Data Scientist with a +4-year foundation in Bioinformatics and Statistical Analysis. I specialize in bridging the gap between complex, high-volume data (from genomics to business) and actionable insights.

My focus is on building and deploying robust data solutions, transforming complex datasets into predictive models and clear visualizations using Python, R, SQL, and modern ML/BI tools.

### 💡 What I Do  
- 🧠 **Machine Learning & AI** — developing predictive models and working on collaborative ML projects.  
- 📊 **Data Analytics** — exploring data cleaning, feature engineering, and visualization with Python, SQL and visualization tools as Tableau or Power BI.  
- 💻 **Programming** — experienced with Python, R, SQL, and UNIX-based environments.  
- 🧬 **Bioinformatics** — previous experience in RNA-Seq, genome annotation, and proteogenomics research.

### 🚀 Featured Projects (Portfolio)

**1. Capstone Project: "DSMarket" (End-to-End Retail Data Science) (ongoing)**

[DS Market - Capstone](https://github.com/asansal/DS_market_Capstone)

**Description:** A comprehensive, end-to-end project simulating a Senior Data Scientist role for a retail chain. The project covered the full data lifecycle, from data ingestion and BI to predictive modeling and strategic deployment.

**Key Features:**

- **Phase 1 (BI & EDA):** Performed EDA and built interactive dashboards in Power BI to identify key product/store performance metrics.

- **Phase 2 (Unsupervised ML):** Implemented K-Means clustering to segment products and stores based on sales behavior.

- **Phase 3 (Forecasting):** Developed and validated Time Series models to forecast sales across different regions.

- **Phase 4 (Business Strategy):** Designed a data-driven business solution for store sourcing and inventory management based on model outputs.

Technologies: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Power BI, SQL.

**2. Machine Learning & AI Projects**

[ML Data Cleaning and Clasification Projects](https://github.com/asansal/ML-data-cleaning-and-classification-projects)
[Road Accident Prediction - Kaggle](https://github.com/asansal/road-accident-risk-prediction)

Description: A collection of applied projects focusing on different ML domains.

Projects Included:

Classification: Developed classification models (XGBoost, Random Forest) to predict outcomes, including advanced data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering (e.g., BMW Dataset Cleaning, MS Malware Prediction).

Deep Learning (CV): Built and trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using TensorFlow/Keras for image classification, implementing models from scratch and using transfer learning.

Technologies: Python, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow, Keras.



### 📈 Data Visualization

- dashboards and storytelling with [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/alejandro.sanchez2642/vizzes) and Power BI.

### 🧩 Past Research  

I previously worked as a Bioinformatics Researcher at the Centro de Biología Molecular Severo Ochoa (CBM, Madrid), focusing on transcriptomics and proteogenomics in Leishmania species.

My work involved developing pipelines (Python, R, Bash) in an HPC environment to analyze RNA-Seq, Ribo-Seq, and ONT data, contributing to 3 peer-reviewed publications.

You can find related scripts and workflows in the [CBMSO-L302 repositories](https://github.com/CBMSO-L302).
